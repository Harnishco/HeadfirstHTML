        <p>My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: 
            <ul>
            <li>cell phone,</li> 
            <li>iPod,</li> 
            <li>digital camera,</li> 
            <li>and a protein bar.</li> 
            </ul>   
        Just the essentails. As Lao Tzu would have said <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step Segway.</q> </p>

        <p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today; <blockquote>Passing cars, <br>
             When you can't see, <br>
             May get you, <br>
             A glimpse, <br>
             Of eternity.<br>
        </blockquote>  I defintely won't be passing any cars. :)</p>

        <p>Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way: 

            <ol>

            <li>Walla Walla, WA,</li> 
            <li>Magic City, ID,</li> 
            <li>Bountiful, UT,</li> 
            <li>Last Chance, CO,</li> 
            <li>Truth or Consequences, NM.</li> 
            <li>Why, AZ,</li>

            </ol>
        </p>
